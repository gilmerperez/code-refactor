# Code Refactor: Horiseon Website

## Description 

Refactored an existing webpage to improve its accessibility. This involves making the site more usable for people with disabilities while ensuring that it meets accessibility standards.

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file to view the refactored webpage. Ensure that all accessibility features, such as semantic HTML and proper alt text, are implemented.

## Instructions

1. Refactor the HTML and CSS code to improve the accessibility of the webpage.

2. Use semantic HTML elements to structure the page logically and intuitively.

3. Ensure that all images have appropriate `alt` attributes.

4. Rework the CSS to make it more efficient and better organized.

4. Follow the Scout Rule and leave the code cleaner than you found it.

## Key Features

* Improved accessibility for users with disabilities.

* Semantic HTML structure for better usability.

* Alt text added to all images for screen readers.

* CSS refactoring for cleaner, more efficient code.

## Technology Stack

This project uses the following tools and technologies:

* **HTML:** Semantic structure for better accessibility.

* **CSS:** Refactored to improve efficiency and readability.

* **Git:** Version control for tracking changes and collaboration.

## HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

One of the most common tasks for front-end and junior developers is to take existing code and refactor it (recall that to refactor code is to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or implement a new technology. In this Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible.


Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses. It ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. Making a website accessible is also good for business for many reasons, one of them being that accessible sites are better positioned in search engines like Google. It also helps companies avoid litigation that can occur when people with disabilities can't access their website.

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented in the Acceptance Criteria section.

To impress clients, you should always go the extra mile and improve the codebase for long-term sustainability. For example, make sure that all links are functioning correctly. Also, rework the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and including comments before each element or section of the page.
